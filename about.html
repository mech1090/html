            Q: How do I redeem my PC Optimum points for Free Rewards?
        </summary>
        With a minimum of 20,000 PC Optimum points, you are eligible to redeem your PC Optimum points for grocery rewards and just about anything else at participating stores across Canada. Just redeem in increments of 10,000 PC Optimum points thereafter right at the checkout.
        For example:
        If you have 37,000 PC Optimum points you are eligible to redeem your PC Optimum points for $30 in free grocery rewards (20,000 PC Optimum points minimum redemption, plus an increment of 10,000 PC Optimum points). The remaining 7,000 points will remain in your PC Optimum points account until you reach the 20,000 PC Optimum points redemption level again.
