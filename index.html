                    Zoos: Good for Animals?
                </h3>
                <p>
                <Strong>Millions of people</Strong>
                 around the world visit zoos. Over 100 countries in the world today have zoos; the United States alone has over 350 zoos. Zoos give people the chance to see animals that they would never come across on a day-to-day basis. While many people love to visit zoos, some think that keeping animals in cages is unfair. These people believe that animals would be better off if they were living in their own natural environment. Although some do see zoos as cruel, there are several ways that zoos actually help animals.
                </p>
                
                 <strong>Of course,</strong>
                  not all zoos are good places for animals to live. Some zoos keep their animals in small cages or pens. Animals trapped in small spaces do not have enough space to exercise, play, or live comfortably. These animals can become depressed, refusing to eat or interact with others. They can also become aggressive, snapping at zookeepers or fighting with the other animals in their pens. Some zoos feed their animals the wrong kinds of food or do not properly care for them when they are sick or hurt. These kinds of zoos are not beneficial for the animals.
                  <p>
                      <strong>On the other hand,</strong>
                     there are many good zoos that treat their animals properly. Good zoos provide lots of space for the animals. They make sure that the animals’ pens or cages look similar to where they would live in the wild. They provide things that will entertain the animals, such as toys, places to climb, or swimming holes. They allow the animals to interact safely with others of their kind. They provide high-quality food for the animals and plenty of clean water. They only employ highly-trained staff members who are experts at caring for animals.
                  </p>
                  <strong>One of the main</strong>
                   ways in which good zoos help animals is in educating people. Zoos help people to learn about and appreciate animals. The more educated people are about animals, the more they will want to help protect them. Most people do not have the opportunity to see a lion or an elephant up close. Seeing an animal in person is a much more moving and memorable experience than seeing one on television or in a book. People who get a chance to see these animals face-to-face are much more likely to participate in wildlife conservation.
                   <p>
                       <strong>Zoos also help</strong>
                     to save endangered species. Some endangered animals’ natural habitats can be unsafe because of hunters, predators, food shortages, diseases, or other dangers. In zoos, these animals are safe, well-fed, and get good medical care. Many zoos also donate money to aid endangered animals in the wild. This money helps to preserve the animals’ native habitats and to educate local people about protecting the animals
