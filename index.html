                Our programs focus on goals that connect learning with the development of life skills, such as the ability to make good choices, communicate well, play, and interact cooperatively with others. It is our goal to support healthy development of the whole child - socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. We encourage parent involvement in our programs and independence in young children.
